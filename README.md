# PyRep repeated-configuration path reproduction

Real before/after renders from CoppeliaSim 4.1. The original interpolation produces seven NaN joint targets during an in-place gripper release; the patch completes the release with finite targets. Both runs replay the same 14-action prefix after independent cold resets. This is a numerical regression demonstration, not whole-task success (reward remains 0).

The video has Chinese/English captions, labelled frozen frames and non-real-time playback. No policy inference was used. Case: place_cups TRAIN episode 0, variation 1, mug1.
